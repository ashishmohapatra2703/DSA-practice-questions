/*In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, 
we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
 Finally, print contents of the stack. 

 Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices
  (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack. */
