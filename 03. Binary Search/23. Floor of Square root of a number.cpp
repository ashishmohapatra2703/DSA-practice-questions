/* Given an integer x. The task is to find the square root of x. 
If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).
Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.    */
