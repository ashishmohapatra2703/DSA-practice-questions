/*Given a non-negative integer n. Reverse the bits of n and print the number obtained after reversing the bits.
Note:  The actual binary representation of the number is being considered for reversing the bits, 
no leading 0â€™s are being considered.

Input : 
N = 11
Output:
13
Explanation:
(11)10 = (1011)2.
After reversing the bits we get: (1101)2 = (13)10.   */
